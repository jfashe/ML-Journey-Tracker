Syntax
1. Print statement
    print("hello world!")

    - Self explanatory. print() is how python outputs to console.
2. Comments
    # This is a comment

    - Also self-explanatory
3. Indentation
    if True:
        print("This is indented correctly")

    - indentation (usually 4 whitespaces) are used to define following blocks of code.

    if True:
    print ("This is not indented correctly, and will casue an error")

# Code isn't really needed for this.

CHATGPT PROMPT:
"I am relearning python, and i havent touched it in years. Ive basically forgot everything. Give me a full, detailed lesson that follows the task:
"Learn basic Python syntax: variables, data types (int, float, str, list, dict)."

I want cheats to make it easier (if they are difficult) and notes aswell. Do not leave out any important information. This will help me with my machine learning journey."

From there on out, I seperated it to three parts.
