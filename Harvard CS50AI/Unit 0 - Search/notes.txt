Search Problems

Terminology
    agent - an entity that perceives its environment, and acts upon that environment
    state - a configuration of the agent in its environment
        initial state - where the agent begins
    actions - choices that can be made in a state
    transition model - a description of the resulting state from performing an action.
        RESULT(s,a) returns the state resulting from performing action a in state s
    state space - the set of all states reachable from the initial state by any sequence of actions
    goal test - a way of determening whether a given state is a goal state
    path cost - numerical cost associated with a given path
    solution - a sequence of actions that leads from the initial state to a goal state
    optimal solution - solution with the lowest path cost among all possible solution

Solving Search Problems:
    Search Problem consist of:
        - initial state
        - actions
        - transition model
        - goal test
        - path cost function

    More Terminology:
        node - a data structure that keeps track of:
            - a state
            - a parent (node that generated this node)
            - an action (action applied to parent to get node)
            - a path cost (from initial state to node)
        Frontier - all the things we could explore that haven't been explored
    
    Approach:
        - Start with a frontier, containing the initial state
        - Repeat:
            - If the frontier is empty, there is no solution.
            - Otherwise, remove a node from the frontier.
            - If the node contains a goal state, return the solution.
            - Otherwise, 'expand' the node, adding resulting nodes to the frontier.
        Decent approach, but doesn't account for nodes that can traverse backwards

    Revised Approach:
        - Start with a frontier,
        - Start with an empty, 'explored' set
        - Repeat:
            - If the frontier is empty, there is no solution.
            - Otherwise, remove a node from the frontier.
            - If the node contains a goal stae, return the solution.
            - Add the node to the explored state
            - Otherwise, 'expand' the node, adding resulting nodes to the frontier, IF they aren't already in the frontier or explored set.
    
    Stack - Last in, first out data-type.
    Queue - First in, first out data-type.
    
    Depth-first search (DFS) - search algorithm that always expands the deepest node in the frontier. Utilizes stacks.

    Breadth-first search (BFS) - search algorithm that always expands the shallowest node in the frontier. Utilizes queues.
