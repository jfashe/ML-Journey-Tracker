1. Between DFS and BFS, which will find a shorter path through a maze?
    - BFS will always find a shorter path than DFS.

    correct answer - BFS will sometimes, but not always find a shorter path than DFS
2. Of the four search algorithms discussed in lecture — depth-first search, breadth-first search, greedy best-first search with Manhattan distance heuristic, and A* search with Manhattan distance heuristic — which one (or multiple, if multiple are possible) could be the algorithm used?
    - Could be either A* or GBFS

    correct answer - Could only be DFS
3. Why is depth-limited minimax sometimes preferable to minimax without a depth limit?

    - Depth-limited minimax will achieve the same output as minimax without a depth limit, but can sometimes use less memory

    correct answer - Depth-limited minimax can arrive at a decision more quickly because it explores fewer states
4. Consider the Minimax tree below, where the green up arrows indicate the MAX player and red down arrows indicate the MIN player. The leaf nodes are each labelled with their value.


Array (Depth = 0)
    MAX:         [X]
    MIN:   X      X     X
    MAX: 9 6 5  1 4 3  7 2 8

Array (Depth = 1)
    MAX:         [X]
    MIN:   5      1     2
    MAX: 9 6 5  1 4 3  7 2 8
    
    Min chooses worst-case (lowest)nodes. 5, 1 and 2.

Array (Depth = 2)
    MAX:         [5]
    MIN:   5      1     2
    MAX: 9 6 5  1 4 3  7 2 8

    Max chooses best case (largest) of given nodes. 5 out of 5, 1 & 2.
    So the root is 5.
