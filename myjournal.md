# ðŸ“˜ Daily Machine Learning Engineering Journal

Why a second, daily journal? Simple. Consistency is easy if you're doing something once a week. But to do something *every* day?

    - Woke up late, got my hair retwisted, and i'm only now starting my day at 8:33 PM.

    - Flew from Baltimore to Houston. Finally back in Texas for this summer semester. Currently 11:59PM as I type this. 
    - Didn't do a single ML-learning thing today nor yesterday. At least I'm finally situated. 
    - Not starting right now (6/4 12:01am) so that I can wake up early and get to it (goal is 7:00am). Night night!
- 6/4/2025 - Week 1 Day 4 (Wednesday)

    - First day of significant progress. Finally going to sleep (6/5 1:42AM). night night
- 6/5/2025 - Week 1 Day 5 (Thursday)
    - Been calculussing all day. Time rn is 4PM, and I'm finishing up the homework.
    - Made a Notion thingy for my calculus 2 summer class, and I've added my daily ML tasks on there aswell. boo-yah
    - 10PM. Still Calculussing. Really need to get my time management together...

    - 4:51PM. This is no longer a joke. My time management is actually horrible. I Didn't do ANYTHING besides cal2 work yesterday.

    - Had to drop my mans off in Houston, took 3 hours off of my day. Finished learning Vectors and Scalars (linear algebra).
