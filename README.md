# 📘 26-Week Machine Learning Engineering Journey

My weekly, interactive checklist designed to track my full ML journey. I am currently studying Computer Engineering at Blinn College (Soon to be UMD).
Documented journey from zero to Machine Learning Internship

---

## 🔰 Overview
- **Duration:** 26 Weeks
- **Start Date:** `Jun 1, 2025`
- **Focus:** Python, Data Science, Machine Learning, MLOps, and Deployment.
- **Personal Focus:** Discipline, self-growth, and consistency.
- **Desired Certifications:** - AWS Certified Machine Learning (Specialty), and Google Cloud Professional ML Engineer, 
- **Hosted On:** GitHub (for public accountability and portfolio visibility)
- **Goal:** To get an internship in ML.
- **Why Journal?** Tired of lying to myself. Tired of saying "I'm going to lock in" and doing nothing. Nothing kills self-esteem like repeatedly breaking promises to yourself.

## 🧭 How it works:
- Overall progress is split into three parts.
    - **Week 1-10:** Python Refresher and core foundations
        - lighter load due to summer classes
    - **Weeks 11-18:** Core Machine Learning
        - Andrew Ng's ML
        - should be familiar with neural nets, k-means, and CNNs.
    - **Weeks 19-25:** Deployment/MLops, projects, and certifications.
        - Should be familiar with Docker.
        - 2 projects utilizing Keras, Docker, and whatever the hell I've learned.
        - MINIMUM 10 internship applications per week
- Each week, I check off my progress using `[ ]` (incomplete) or `[x]` (complete)
- **If you're seeing this, everything should be empty `[  ]`, since it's day one of week one!**
- I'll be using the **Side Notes** section for reflections, questions, and action items
- This readme IS a weekly sumamry of my journey. The daily journal is `myjournal.md`. This is basically a living document to track and share my ML journey

## 👨🏾‍💻Sidenotes:
- Everyone keeps telling me to get a laptop for engineering. F* that, you cant do this on windows😂☠️🙈🎶😏
