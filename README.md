# 📘 26-Week Machine Learning Engineering Journey

My weekly, interactive checklist designed to track my full ML journey. I am currently studying Computer Engineering at Blinn College (Soon to be UMD).
Documented journey from zero to Machine Learning Internship

---

## 🔰 Overview
- **Duration:** 26 Weeks
- **Start Date:** `Jun 1, 2025`
- **Focus:** Python, Data Science, Machine Learning, MLOps, and Deployment.
- **Personal Focus:** Discipline, self-growth, and consistency.
- **Desired Certifications:** - AWS Certified Machine Learning (Specialty), and Google Cloud Professional ML Engineer, 
- **Hosted On:** GitHub (for public accountability and portfolio visibility)
- **Goal:** To get an internship in ML.
- **Why Journal?** Tired of lying to myself. Tired of saying "I'm going to lock in" and doing nothing. Nothing kills self-esteem like repeatedly breaking promises to yourself. So I'm journaling not only my ML journey, but my self-growth journey aswell.

## 🧭 How it works:
- Overall progress is split into three parts.
    - **Week 1-10:** Python Refresher and core foundations
        - lighter load due to summer classes
    - **Weeks 11-18:** Core Machine Learning
        - Andrew Ng's ML
        - should be familiar with neural nets, k-means, and CNNs.
    - **Weeks 19-25:** Deployment/MLops, projects, and certifications.
        - Should be familiar with Docker.
        - 2 projects utilizing Keras, Docker, and whatever the hell I've learned.
        - MINIMUM 10 internship applications per week
- Each week, I check off my progress using `[ ]` (incomplete) or `[x]` (complete)
- **If you're seeing this, everything should be empty `[  ]`, since it's day one of week one!**
- I'll be using the **Side Notes** section for reflections, questions, and action items
- This readme IS a weekly sumamry of my journey. The daily journal is `myjournal.md`. This is basically a living document to track and share my ML journey

## ✅ Weekly Progress Checklist

### 📅 Week 1 – Python Basics & Core Math (Linear Algebra)
#### Week of Sun, Jun 1 - Sat, Jun 7
- 🎯 **Learning Objectives**
  - Reacquaint with Python syntax, variables, data types, loops.
  - Learn vector basics in Linear Algebra.
- 📦 **Key Tasks**
  - [X] Learn basic Python syntax: variables, data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `list`, `dict`)
  - [ ] Review data types, variables, control flow (`if`, `for`, `while`)
  - [ ] Practice loops: write FizzBuzz, sum a list, list comprehensions.
  - [ ] Start Khan Academy Linear Algebra – Vectors, Scalars
  - [ ] Apply to 1 MIS/data related internship.
- 💡 **Notes & Insights**
  - I’m essentially rebuilding from zero... Aside from Calculus 1, I've learned almost nothing from my time (so far) in college. I know it only gets harder from here, but with God, all things are possible. Resources Used: [DataCamp Cheat Sheet](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/python-cheat-sheet)
- 🌱 **Self-Growth Focus**
  - Journal 3 personal values (e.g., discipline, curiosity, growth).
